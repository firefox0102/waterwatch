To-do

Item, assignee, hours
CRK Firebase Account  Yes with Erik Create it prior to migration, Leslie, 0.5
Report generators, Leslie, 15
User guide write up, Lauren, 4
Lauren to style Add New Site modal
Lauren to get copy for chart 'more information' blurbs
Leslie to work on map layers and report export functionality for consumer-facing page
About page: Content taken from CRK site - ok?; ’Are the fish safe…” referenced link is broken. Have a fix?
HUCS include pop-ups when clicking on layer that shows name
LABS Include pop-up w/ name of lab & address. Coords. & address.
Add Streams & River Flowlines & (if possible) waterbodies – The basemap doesn’t seem to show a lot of these, so it would nice to have on the map. Info is also in 9/26 email. Do not need the button to turn this layer off
Graphs – List units by axis, “Last result”, and in mouseover popup. Switch date format on
axis to “11/24/17” instead of “24. Nov”

**WILL NOT GET TO** DO LAST Collection Site Data page - Do you have bandwidth to display E. Coli # colored based on values? e.g. red=high (would need high vs low values from Erik)
 IGNORE Sign In page: errors showing up at bottom instead of inline (shows generic “there was an issue” message) Can we display validation inline to have then retry email/password?
 IGNORE FOR NOW All date pickers - default date should be today’s date. Format MM/DD/YYYY
 IGNORE FOR NOW Collection Site Data page - when click Log New Data - link should take to Log Data page but with Collection Site already populated
 IGNORE FOR NOW Collection Site Data page - First Collection Date date format in summary and column should be MM/DD/YYYY
